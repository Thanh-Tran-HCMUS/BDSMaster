First of all thanks for buying this assets!

You will find HDRP setup tutorial in this folder - HDRP Setup Tutorial.pdf

Setup for URP project almost the same, only difference you need add Universal RP package via Package Manager.

For standard project version only need to add Post Processing package.

URP and HDRP projects included in this folder as separate unitypackages.

You need create clear unity project and import URP or HDRP packcage - Assets/Import Package/Custom Package.
